#Trapezium rule
The first technique is the trapezium rule. For some function f(x), the integral from x=a to x=b consists in dividing the interval in **n** parts, and at each integration step the **x** increments some amplitude **h**, where **h=|(b-a)|/n**. For the first step, we build a trapezium which area is (f(a) + f(a+h))/2 * h.
